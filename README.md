# SokoGrid

SokoGrid is a clon of a Sokoban clone called [Starpusher](https://github.com/silshack/starpusher) by Al Sweigert, with graphics from the [Planet Cute](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) collection and levels by David W. Skinner.

This version was created using the new CSS Grid to create the game board. Although it wasn't necessary due its low complexity, React was also used, exploring the use of React state in games.
